	<h2>Hello</h2>
	<h3><i>          </i></h3>
	<img src="img/unnamed.jpg" width="300px">
	<p>Hello, it's me<br />
	I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet<br />
	To go over everything<br />
	They say that time's supposed to heal ya<br />
	But I ain't done much healing<br />
	<br />
	Hello, can you hear me<br />
	I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be<br />
	When we were younger and free<br />
	I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet<br />
	<br />
	There's such a difference between us<br />
	And a million miles<br />
	<br />
	Hello from the other side<br />
	I must have called a thousand times<br />
	To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done<br />
	But when I call you never seem to be home<br />
	<br />
	Hello from the outside<br />
	At least I can say that I've tried<br />
	To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart<br />
	But it don't matter it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore<br />
	<br />
	Hello, how are you?<br />
	It's so typical of me to talk about myself I'm sorry<br />
	I hope that you're well<br />
	Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened<br />
	<br />
	It's no secret that the both of us<br />
	Are running out of time<br />
	<br />
	So hello from the other side<br />
	I must have called a thousand times<br />
	To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done<br />
	But when I call you never seem to be home<br />
	Hello from the outside<br />
	At least I can say that I've tried<br />
	To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart<br />
	But it don't matter it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore<br />
	<br />
	Ooooohh, anymore<br />
	Ooooohh, anymore<br />
	Ooooohh, anymore<br />
	Anymore<br />
	<br />
	Hello from the other side<br />
	I must have called a thousand times<br />
	To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done<br />
	But when I call you never seem to be home<br />
	Hello from the outside<br />
	At least I can say that I've tried<br />
	To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart<br />
	But it don't matter it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore</p>
